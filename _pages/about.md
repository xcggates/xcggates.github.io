Hi, I’m Xinzhou (Shawn) Ge, a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Oregon State University, where I’ve been since September 2023.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Jingyi Jessica Li, and continued working with her as a postdoctoral researcher from 2021 to 2023. Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from Peking University.

My research focuses on statistical modeling and algorithm development, as well as their application to high-throughput sequencing data in bioinformatics research. My major research topics include:

1. Enhancement of statistical rigor in biological data analysis:
- P-value-free false discovery control of high-throughput data analysis
- Examination and correction of misused statistical models in bioinformatics algorithms
- Large-scale differential analysis in bulk and single-cell genomics with strict false discovery rate control
2. Developing statistical and computational models for:
- Isoform-level quantitative trait loci analysis in statistical genetics
- Cancer risk prediction using high-throughput sequencing data in clinical research
- Comparative analysis and signal detection in epigenomics
